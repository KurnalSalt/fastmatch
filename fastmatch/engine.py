"""Device-agnostic, tiled, multi-scale normalized-cross-correlation engine.

This module implements :class:`Matcher`, the GPU-accelerated (CUDA when present,
CPU otherwise) template-search core of FastMatch. It has **zero Qt imports** —
it speaks only numpy/torch and the Qt-free dataclasses in :mod:`fastmatch.types`
so it can run on a worker thread (or, in principle, out-of-process) without
dragging GUI types along.

Algorithm overview (see ``docs/DESIGN.md`` §D for the authoritative spec):

* Fast NCC via **separable box filters** for the windowed sum ``S1`` and
  sum-of-squares ``S2`` (so the per-window variance costs ``O(th+tw)`` not
  ``O(th*tw)``), plus a single full 2-D cross-correlation for the cross term
  ``sum_w(I * Tz)`` using a zero-mean template ``Tz``. Box filters (not a global
  summed-area table) keep float32 round-off bounded by window size rather than
  image size.
* The cross-correlation uses spatial ``F.conv2d`` for small templates and an
  FFT (``torch.fft.rfft2``) once ``th*tw > 4096`` where the FFT's
  ``O(N log N)`` beats the dense conv.
* The output grid is processed in **non-overlapping core tiles** with a halo of
  ``(th-1, tw-1)`` on the right/bottom so no valid top-left position is ever
  split across a tile boundary. Only detections centered in the tile core are
  kept; the final global NMS dedupes any seam straddlers.
* Multi-scale scales the *template* (the per-image precompute is reused), pools
  candidates from every scale, then runs **one** global NMS so the best scale
  wins at each location.
* On CUDA an OOM degradation ladder (1024 -> 512 tile -> fewer scales -> CPU)
  keeps the search alive instead of crashing.
