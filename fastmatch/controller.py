"""Match orchestration: QThread ownership, debounce, cancel, and stale-drop.

:class:`MatchController` is the single seam between the GUI (viewport / main
window, which speak ``QRect`` in image px) and the headless engine (which speaks
plain numpy + :class:`fastmatch.types.MatchParams`). It owns exactly one
long-lived :class:`~PySide6.QtCore.QThread` running one
:class:`fastmatch.worker.MatchWorker`, and enforces the resolved threading model
from DESIGN.md §F.1: **single in-flight job, latest-wins, 120 ms debounce.**

Request lifecycle (DESIGN.md §F.2):

1. :meth:`request` validates + clips the rect (rejecting too-small / whole-image
   / extreme-aspect selections), cancels any in-flight job, and (re)arms the
   debounce timer.
2. On debounce fire, :meth:`_dispatch` crops the template from the (read-only)
   document, bumps ``job_id``, announces busy, and emits the queued run signal.
3. The worker runs ``match`` off-thread and emits ``finished``/``error`` back.
4. :meth:`_on_finished` / :meth:`_on_error` drop stale results (``job_id !=``
   current) and otherwise surface them via :attr:`matches_ready` / :attr:`failed`.

Coordinate contract (DESIGN.md §F.3): all boxes here are half-open integer image
px, origin top-left, +x right / +y down. The viewport has already applied the
floor-TL / ceil-BR rounding rule when producing the ``QRect``; the controller
only clips to image bounds and crops.
