"""The match worker that runs the engine on a dedicated QThread.

``MatchWorker`` is a plain ``QObject`` (not a ``QThread`` subclass) so it can be
``moveToThread``'d onto the single long-lived matching thread owned by
:class:`fastmatch.controller.MatchController`. It wraps a
:class:`fastmatch.engine.Matcher` and exposes the engine's blocking
``match()`` call as the queued :meth:`run` slot.

Three invariants hold this layer together (see DESIGN.md §C.6, §F.1, §F.2):

* **One worker, one in-flight job.** The owning thread runs a single
  ``match()`` at a time; the controller debounces and stale-drops by ``job_id``.
* **Plain CPU payloads only.** Signals carry ``list[Match]`` dataclasses and
  ``str`` — never CUDA tensors, large ndarrays, or QPixmaps. The engine has
  already done ``.cpu()`` before returning, so nothing GPU-resident crosses a
  signal boundary (DESIGN.md §M7).
* **Cooperative cancellation.** :meth:`request_cancel` sets a
  :class:`threading.Event` that the engine polls at every tile boundary via the
  ``cancel`` callback. Because the event is shared mutable state touched from the
  GUI thread (set) and the worker thread (read), it must be a thread-safe
  primitive — hence ``threading.Event`` rather than a bare bool.
