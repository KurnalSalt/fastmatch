"""Cross-boundary data types for FastMatch.

These dataclasses are the contract that the engine, controller, worker, and
viewport all speak. They are deliberately **Qt-free and picklable** so they can
ride across QThread signal/slot boundaries (and a process boundary, if we ever
move matching out-of-process) without dragging GUI types along.

Coordinate convention (canonical, applied everywhere outside the viewport):
    integer **image pixels**, origin top-left, +x right / +y down (matches
    numpy ``arr[y, x]``, Pillow, and QImage). A box ``(x, y, w, h)`` is
    **half-open**: it covers ``x in [x, x+w)`` and ``y in [y, y+h)``, so
    ``full[y:y+h, x:x+w]`` yields an ``(h, w, 3)`` crop.
